    Rods can be confusing due to all the different styles, actions and powers.
    Even though the market is flooded with rods, they can be sorted fairly
    easily if you understand the terminology. I will go through each aspect that
    needs to be considered in order to get the right rod for the right application.

    <h3>Rod Power</h3>
      <p>
        The power rating of a rod can be described as the how stout or strong the rod is.
        If we look at the chart shown above, the power ratings are rated from UL (Ultra
        light) to XH (Extra Heavy). Each power has a Lure Weight rating which helps
        determine what range the rod is best suited for. An Extra Heavy rod may have a
        rating for 1-6 oz, while an Ultra Light may be rated from 1/32-1/8 oz. For the
        best performance out of a rod, it is best to use lures that are near the center of
        the weight rating. If you wanted to use a 3 oz swimbait, it would easily break
        an Ultra Light rod in half. On the other hand, if you were looking to through a 1/16
        oz finesse jig an Extra Heavy rod would not even load enough to throw it more than a
        few feet.

    <h3>Rod Action</h3>
      <p>
        A rod action is best described on how quickly a rod goes from being bent
        to then returning to being in its normal straight position. It can also
        be described as how far the rod will flex before it transitions to its
        "backbone" or stiff section of the rod. The chart above shows this better
        than i can put into words. A rod with an Extra Fast or Fast action is best
        used for baits fished on bottom such as jigs, Texas rigs, Carolina rigs,
        Shakey heads, drop shots and many other rigs. They can also be great for
        baits that need to action to be created by the angler like jerkbaits and
        topwaters. Rods with Mod-Fast, Moderate or Slow action are great for
        baits like crankbaits mainly. These rods act as a shock absorber to keep
        treble hook baits from being shook free. This works because if the line is
        allowed to go slack when a fish shakes it's head, it is much easier for
        the fish to spit the bait.
