      Choosing a reel is a process. There are differents styles and sizes of reels that are
      best suited for certain applications. There are two main styles of reels in the bass
      fishing world. Low Profile baitcasters (on left) and Spinning reels (on right) are the
      two major styles used in the bass fishing world. See the table below to see the short
